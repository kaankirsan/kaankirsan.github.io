            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Executed comprehensive train wagon durability test system with hydraulic power units, multi-sensor integration, and safety-critical validation protocols. Implemented load testing scenarios covering 50+ different conditions with automated data collection and analysis. Ensured regulatory compliance through comprehensive safety protocols and documentation traceability. Successfully validated railway components meeting international safety standards.</p>

            <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
            <p>The system was architected around a robust PLC-based control platform managing hydraulic actuators capable of simulating various stress conditions experienced during railway operation. Multi-axis load application with precision force control was implemented using industrial-grade hydraulic power units and proportional valves.</p>

            <p>Safety was paramount in the design, with redundant emergency stop circuits, pressure relief systems, and fail-safe logic ensuring operator protection and equipment integrity. The HMI provided comprehensive monitoring and control, displaying real-time sensor data including pressure, displacement, strain, and temperature across multiple measurement points.</p>

            <p>Data acquisition systems captured high-frequency sensor readings with precise timestamping, enabling detailed analysis of material behavior under cyclic loading conditions. Automated test sequences were programmed to replicate real-world operational profiles, including shock loads, sustained loading, and fatigue testing scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Key Results & Impact</h2>
            <p>The testing system successfully validated 50+ different load conditions, providing comprehensive durability data for railway component certification. Regulatory compliance was achieved through meticulous documentation, traceability systems, and adherence to international safety standards for railway equipment testing.</p>

            <p>Safety-critical design elements ensured zero incidents during extensive testing campaigns, with all emergency systems functioning as designed. The automated data collection and analysis capabilities reduced manual intervention, improved test repeatability, and accelerated the certification process for critical railway components.</p>

            <p>The system's flexibility allowed for customization of test profiles to meet specific component requirements, making it a valuable asset for quality assurance and product development in the railway industry.</p>
