            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Engineered comprehensive safety-critical PLC system for precision motor control in high-risk industrial applications meeting SIL 2 safety requirements. Developed fail-safe logic architecture with redundant safety circuits, emergency stop integration, and comprehensive fault diagnostics with automatic error logging. Implemented advanced motion control algorithms for multi-axis servo systems with position feedback, velocity profiling, and torque limiting for safe operation. Integrated safety-rated sensors and actuators with complete I/O diagnostics, achieving zero safety incidents across 5000+ operational cycles in production environment.</p>

            <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
            <p>The system was architected on the Siemens S7-1500 Safety PLC platform, specifically selected for its certified safety capabilities and robust performance in industrial environments. The safety logic design followed IEC 61508 standards for Safety Integrity Level (SIL) 2 applications, implementing redundant safety chains and fail-safe operational modes.</p>

            <p>TIA Portal was utilized for comprehensive system development, including safety logic programming using Safety-Oriented Structured Text (SCL) and Function Block Diagram (FBD). The safety program incorporated automatic monitoring of critical parameters, with safe state transitions triggered by any detected fault conditions.</p>

            <p>Multi-axis servo control was implemented using Profinet communication with safety-rated servo drives. Advanced motion profiles were programmed to ensure smooth acceleration, precise positioning, and controlled deceleration. Torque limiting algorithms prevented mechanical damage and ensured operator safety during unexpected load conditions or collisions.</p>

            <p>Emergency stop circuits were designed with dual-channel redundancy, incorporating cross-monitoring to detect discrepancies between channels. Safety-rated input modules monitored e-stop buttons, light curtains, safety gates, and enabling devices. Safety-rated output modules controlled motor contactors, brakes, and other critical actuators.</p>

            <p>The HMI provided comprehensive safety monitoring, displaying safety circuit status, diagnostic information, and alarm management. Fault diagnostics included detailed error logging with timestamps, fault locations, and automatic notification systems for critical safety events.</p>

            <h2>Key Results & Impact</h2>
            <p>Achieving SIL 2 certification validated the system's design rigor and compliance with international safety standards. This certification provided confidence to operators, regulatory authorities, and stakeholders that the system met stringent safety requirements for industrial machinery.</p>

            <p>Zero safety incidents across 5000+ operational cycles demonstrated the system's reliability and robustness in real-world production environments. This outstanding safety record reflected the effectiveness of the redundant safety architecture, comprehensive fault detection, and fail-safe design principles.</p>

            <p>The precision motor control capabilities enabled high-quality manufacturing processes while maintaining operator safety. Position accuracy within micrometers was achieved through closed-loop servo control with real-time feedback and adaptive control algorithms.</p>

            <p>Comprehensive fault diagnostics significantly reduced troubleshooting time, allowing maintenance personnel to quickly identify and resolve issues. The automatic error logging system provided valuable data for preventive maintenance planning and continuous improvement initiatives.</p>

            <p>The project demonstrated expertise in safety-critical systems engineering, industrial motion control, and regulatory compliance - skills essential for developing reliable automation systems in high-risk applications.</p>
