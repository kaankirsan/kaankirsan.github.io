            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Developed advanced sensor fusion platform integrating ultrasonic, infrared, and proximity sensors for autonomous navigation in complex industrial environments. Implemented real-time sensor data processing with Kalman filtering for enhanced accuracy and reliability in dynamic obstacle detection. Designed modular architecture supporting multiple sensor configurations with hot-swappable sensor modules and automatic calibration protocols. Achieved 92% obstacle avoidance success rate in cluttered warehouse environments with 200+ operational hours of continuous testing and validation.</p>

            <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
            <p>The Robot V19 was designed with a modular sensor architecture, allowing for flexible configuration based on operational requirements. The STM32-based embedded system handled low-level sensor interfacing, performing real-time data acquisition from multiple sensor types simultaneously.</p>

            <p>Sensor fusion algorithms implemented in C++ combined data from ultrasonic sensors (for long-range detection), infrared sensors (for medium-range precision), and proximity sensors (for close-range obstacle detection). Extended Kalman Filtering was employed to fuse these disparate sensor readings into a unified environmental model, compensating for individual sensor limitations and noise characteristics.</p>

            <p>The ROS 2 framework provided the communication infrastructure, enabling distributed processing and modular software architecture. Navigation algorithms leveraged the fused sensor data to make real-time path planning decisions, dynamically adjusting trajectories to avoid detected obstacles while maintaining progress toward goals.</p>

            <p>Hot-swappable sensor modules were designed with standardized interfaces, allowing sensors to be added, removed, or replaced without system shutdown. Automatic calibration protocols detected new sensors and performed self-calibration routines, adapting fusion parameters to maintain optimal performance.</p>

            <p>Extensive testing in simulated warehouse environments provided realistic operational conditions, including moving obstacles, varying lighting conditions, and cluttered spaces with narrow passages.</p>

            <h2>Key Results & Impact</h2>
            <p>The 92% obstacle avoidance success rate demonstrated the effectiveness of the multi-sensor fusion approach, significantly outperforming single-sensor navigation systems. The remaining 8% of cases typically involved edge scenarios such as transparent obstacles, extremely low-clearance situations, or sensor occlusion conditions.</p>

            <p>Over 200 hours of continuous operational testing validated the system's reliability and robustness. The modular architecture proved valuable for adapting to different environmental conditions, with sensor configurations easily adjusted for specific application requirements.</p>

            <p>The automatic calibration capability reduced deployment time and eliminated the need for specialized technical expertise during sensor maintenance or replacement. This feature significantly enhanced the practical viability of the robot for real-world industrial applications.</p>

            <p>The project provided valuable insights into sensor fusion techniques, real-time embedded systems programming, and autonomous navigation challenges in unstructured industrial environments. The ROS 2 implementation demonstrated proficiency in modern robotics software frameworks and distributed systems architecture.</p>
