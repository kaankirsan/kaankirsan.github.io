            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Providing comprehensive troubleshooting and commissioning services for industrial automation systems across 30+ manufacturing facilities. Expert technical support spanning PLC programming (Siemens, Delta, Omron, Fatek), HMI development, motor control systems, industrial communication protocols (Modbus, Profinet, RS-485), and robotic integration. Field service excellence delivering rapid problem resolution, system optimization, and equipment commissioning ensuring minimal production downtime.</p>

            <h2>Service Approach</h2>
            <p>Troubleshooting services begin with systematic problem diagnosis using structured methodologies combining equipment inspection, documentation review, operational observation, and diagnostic testing. Multi-platform expertise enables effective troubleshooting across diverse automation equipment including PLCs from multiple manufacturers, various HMI systems, servo drives, VFDs, and industrial communication networks.</p>

            <p>Technical support covers the complete problem lifecycle from initial diagnosis through root cause analysis, solution implementation, testing, and documentation. Diagnostic tools include PLC programming software (TIA Portal, WPLSoft, CX-Programmer), oscilloscopes, multimeters, protocol analyzers, and specialized industrial communication testing equipment.</p>

            <p>System commissioning services ensure new automation equipment is properly installed, configured, tested, and validated before production deployment. Commissioning procedures include I/O verification, control logic validation, HMI testing, communication network setup, safety system validation, and comprehensive performance testing under simulated and actual production conditions.</p>

            <p>Field service capabilities provide on-site support across diverse industrial environments including manufacturing plants, warehouses, testing facilities, and outdoor installations. 24/7 emergency support availability ensures rapid response to critical production issues minimizing downtime impact on business operations.</p>

            <p>Documentation is a key component of all services, providing detailed troubleshooting reports, solution descriptions, root cause analysis, and recommendations for preventive measures. Knowledge transfer ensures facility personnel understand problems encountered and solutions implemented, building internal capability for future maintenance.</p>

            <h2>Key Results & Impact</h2>
            <p>Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills using diagnostic tools on hydraulic machines over the years. Analyzed and resolved wiring faults, sensor failures, and programming errors throughout 5 years of experience.</p>

            <p>Recovered faulty machines by replacing outdated PLCs, HMIs, and disorganized wiring with improved components and rebuilt programs from scratch. Proficient with oscilloscope, multimeter, and related diagnostic tools for troubleshooting and testing.</p>

            <p>Multi-platform expertise spanning Siemens, Delta, Omron, and Fatek PLCs, various HMI systems, diverse motor control platforms, and multiple industrial communication protocols enables effective support across heterogeneous automation environments.</p>

            <p>System commissioning services ensure new automation equipment is properly configured and validated before production deployment, reducing startup issues and accelerating time to full operational capability. Comprehensive testing and documentation provide facilities with confidence in system reliability and performance.</p>

            <p>The combination of technical expertise, systematic problem-solving, field service experience, and customer-focused support has built long-term relationships with clients who rely on expert troubleshooting and commissioning services to maintain production reliability and operational efficiency.</p>
