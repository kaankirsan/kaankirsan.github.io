            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Automated Storage and Retrieval System (AS/RS) optimization for major industrial client Arcelik. Implemented comprehensive PLC logic improvements, enhanced HMI diagnostics, and cycle time optimization improving system performance significantly. The project focused on maximizing warehouse throughput while ensuring reliability and reducing operational costs.</p>

            <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
            <p>The AS/RS optimization project involved in-depth analysis of existing Siemens S7 PLC logic to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the automated storage and retrieval operations. Advanced motion control algorithms were implemented to optimize crane movements, reducing unnecessary travel time and energy consumption.</p>

            <p>PLC logic was restructured to improve task scheduling, implementing intelligent queue management for storage and retrieval requests. Priority-based algorithms ensured critical operations received preferential handling while maintaining overall system throughput.</p>

            <p>The HMI interface was redesigned with enhanced diagnostic capabilities, providing real-time visibility into system performance metrics, fault conditions, and operational statistics. Predictive maintenance indicators were integrated to alert operators to potential issues before they resulted in downtime.</p>

            <p>Motion control systems were fine-tuned for precise positioning while maintaining high-speed operation. Safety interlocks and collision avoidance systems were validated and optimized to ensure operator safety and protect valuable inventory.</p>

            <h2>Key Results & Impact</h2>
            <p>The optimization efforts achieved an impressive 99.5% system uptime, significantly reducing unplanned downtime and associated costs for the client. Cycle time improvements directly translated to increased warehouse throughput, allowing the facility to handle higher volumes without additional infrastructure investment.</p>

            <p>Enhanced diagnostics capabilities reduced troubleshooting time, enabling maintenance teams to quickly identify and resolve issues. The predictive maintenance features helped prevent equipment failures, further contributing to the exceptional uptime performance.</p>

            <p>Cost reduction was realized through decreased energy consumption from optimized motion profiles, reduced maintenance costs from predictive alerts, and increased operational efficiency. The project demonstrated the significant value that can be extracted from existing automation infrastructure through targeted optimization.</p>

            <p>Working with a major industrial client like Arcelik provided valuable experience in managing high-stakes projects where system reliability directly impacts production schedules and business operations.</p>
